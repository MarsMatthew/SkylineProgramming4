## Project description

Card Crawler is a two dimensional graphics based game. Classic Dungeon crawler experience, but played like a deck of playing cards. The user starts by picking up a card that gives two options, they then flip the card to the left or to the right to select an option. The object of the game is to survive for as long as possible and collect gold for a high score. Purpose of the project: Learn and practice file handeling, interfaces, and create an entertaining game.

Written in Processing Java
